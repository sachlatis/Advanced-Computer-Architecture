# Advanced-Computer-Architecture

This repository contains the programming exercises and the lab reports for ECE NTUA course Advanced Computer Architecture </br>

## Lab 1: 
We had to carry out a series of measurements in order to estimate Ï„he effect of the most important parameters of the memory hierarchy on performance.
## Lab 2: 
Creation of branch predictors
## Lab 3: 
In this exercise we were asked to study the effect of the dispatch_width (dw) parameter, which refers to the plurality of the commands being issued simultaneously in our processor, and of the window_size (ws), i.e. the size of the ROB (re-order buffer).
## Lab 4: 
The purpose of this lab was to run a series of metrics in order to estimate the effect of different sync mechanisms on multi-core systems.

## Tools Used: 
Sniper Multicore Simulator, PIN and a number of benchmarks.

P.S. In this repository you can only find the code for the first lab.
